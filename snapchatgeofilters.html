			<div class="content">
				<p>I had a lot of free time on my hands over my summer break and this was around the time when I'd started using Geofilters on Snapchat. The concept of having location based filters really intrigued me. This one day I visited Jantar Mantar in New Delhi and realised that it didn't have a geofilter of its own. That's how it started. I illustrated the monument on Illustrator and decided to submit it as a geofilter to Snapchat. They took about 3 months to get back to me, and one fine day I got an e-mail stating that my filter had been approved and was live. With the help of an app, I changed my device's location to Jantar Mantar and there it was - something I created was out there for anyone to use. I felt like I'd finally contributed to the design community even though this was a really small contribution, it made me believe in myself.

			<div class="content">
				<p>Once the illustration was finalised, I moved on to deciding the colors for it. This was a little challenging since any of the photographs I picked for references had a lot of shades of the same color and I needed to pick the one that worked best for me. After spending hours on deciding the color scheme, I finally finished and this is what it ended up looking like.

				<p>Three of my geofilters got approved in total. The other two are - Lajpat Nagar in New Delhi and Narsee Monjee Institute of Management Studies in Mumbai, Maharashtra.

				<div class="content">
				<p>This one is just a simple play with typography since there is no one thing that defines Lajpat Nagar. I decided to go with a subtle yet vibrant color scheme for this one since it is popular for the market place, which is super vibrant.

				<p>This one is a minimal illustration of the college building for NMIMS along with bold text that tells the viewers the name of the college. I made this geofilter for this specific college since my friend started studying there and he felt super sad about living away from home, and I wanted to do what I could to remind him that I hadn't forgotten him.
