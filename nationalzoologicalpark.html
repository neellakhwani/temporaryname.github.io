			<h1 class="projecttitle">Designing The National Zoological Park Experience</h1>
			<div class="date">May 2018</div>
			<div class="content">
				<p>For our final project, the students formed teams of up to 5 people across various design disciplines. Each team was assigned a place in Delhi, where they conducted field research to identify problems, analyze them, and then come up with design solutions.
				</p>
				<h1 class ="subtitle">The Field Visit</h1>
				<p>My team was assigned the National Zoological Park at Pragati Maidan, and we visited the park on 1 April, 2018.
				</p>
				<h1 class ="subtitle">Ticket Counter(s)</h1>
				<p>My team and I reached at about 1:30 pm on a Sunday, and found long queues at each of the 10 ticket counters. Each of us took a different line in the hopes that we could get the tickets faster, but it still took us about 35 minutes.</p>
				<p>Once we finally managed to get the tickets and entered the zoo, we came across a second counter. Visitors can either walk around the nearly 71 hectare area of the zoo, or buy tickets for the Battery Operated Trolley (B.O.T) which runs every few minutes and provides a quicker way to get around the zoo. Buying tickets for the BOT took us another 20 minutes — at this point we had spent almost an hour standing in lines, and it was not a great start to our zoo experience.</p>

			<div class="content">
				<h1 class ="subtitle">Signage</h1>
				<p>We eventually got on the trolley and started moving towards the animal enclosures. We noticed that the zoo uses signage in English and Hindi to help people navigate through the various sections. However, these were only directional, and did not provide information about distances.</p>

				<div class="content">
				<h1 class ="subtitle">Problems Identified</h1>
				<ol class="list">
					<li class="problems">Long lines for tickets</li>
				<p>They have ten counters for ticketing yet it takes a long time to get to the counter since they occasionally shut a counter and ask everyone to shift to the next one. Online ticketing could also help reduce the load on the physical counters.</p>

					<li class="problems">Separate counter for the battery operated trolley (B.O.T) ticket</li>
				<p>After entering, there is a separate counter for the B.O.T tickets, which has another long queue. The counters could easily be merged into one, with two kinds of tickets — either with or without the trolley access.</p>

					<li class="problems">Directional signs</li>
				<p>The current wayfinding system at the zoo points in the general direction of the different sections of the zoo and doesn’t tell you how far a specific enclosure is either in terms of distance or time by foot or trolley.</p>

					<li class="problems">Information outside the enclosures</li>
				<p>The information outside the enclosures is written only in English and Hindi. However, we noticed a lot of people who could not read either of the two languages and might want to read in a language that they are comfortable with.</p>

					<li class="problems">Updates about the zoo</li>
				<p>The general public doesn’t get any updates about the events or developments at the zoo unless its something like a man falling into the tiger enclosure.</p>
				</div>
				
				<div class="content">
				<p>I considered two possible ways to implement my solutions — digital touchscreens and wayfinding system close to each enclosure and a mobile application. I considered the pros and cons of both, but due to the difficulties of maintaining digital touchscreens in the zoo, letting people use their own devices made more sense and thus I decided to go with designing the application.
				</p>
				</div>
				<div class="content">
					<h1 class ="subtitle">The Solution</h1>
				<p>I believe that making a mobile application for the National Zoological Park will help solve all of the above mentioned problems and will improve the overall experience of the visitor.
